In the country of Amerin, she's one of a select few with magical gifts known as whisperers. Every year, the Royal College accepts a small number of new students, all magically inclined, all whisperers.

Oh, and especially if she brings her six ghostly boyfriends with her to the academy (including the recently deceased crown prince, a master thief hanged for his crimes, and a former student of the Royal College). What kind of spirit whisperer is Brynn of Haversey if she can't exorcise her own soulmates?<br /><br />But Brynn isn't attending the most prestigious academy in the world to become a better exorcist - she's searching for a way to bring her lovers back to life....<br /><br /><i>Spirited </i>is a full-length reverse harem romance with a (slightly) clumsy but still kick-butt angel heroine and her six boyfriends who just happen to be ghosts. <b>This book includes foul language, violence, and sexual situations.</b>"

      'On this uniquely forthright and captivating program (recorded live), psychic and best-selling author Sylvia Browne addresses the fascinating concepts surrounding angels and spirit guides. Every religion has angels, Sylvia tell us. Different from spirit guides, angels are spiritual messengers who are available to help us if we simply ask for their assistance. Sylvia goes on to discuss the properties of angels; the true nature of God, good, evil, and the Other Side; and explains how we can overcome guilt, accept ourselves, and thereby understand our own particular "contract." \n<br /> In the second half of the program, Sylvia leads a meditation that invokes the presence of our angels and individual spirit guides, and invites them to communicate with us. We feel their protection, receive their healing, and with Sylvia\'s encouragement, learn how to ask them for the help we desire.'

      "Winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award for Nonfiction <br /><br />When three-month-old Lia Lee arrived at the county hospital emergency room in Merced, California, a chain of events was set in motion from which neither she nor her parents nor her doctors would ever recover. Lia's parents, Foua and Nao Kao, were part of a large Hmong community in Merced, refugees from the CIA-run \"Quiet War\" in Laos. The Hmong, traditionally a close-knit people, have been less amenable to assimilation than most immigrants, adhering steadfastly to the rituals and beliefs of their ancestors. Lia's pediatricians, Neil Ernst and his wife, Peggy Philip, cleaved just as strongly to another tradition: that of Western medicine. <br /><br />When Lia Lee entered the American medical system, diagnosed as an epileptic, her story became a tragic case history of cultural miscommunication. Parents and doctors both wanted the best for Lia, but their ideas about the causes of her illness and its treatment could hardly have been more different. The Hmong see illness and healing as spiritual matters linked to virtually everything in the universe while medical community marks a division between body and soul and concerns itself almost exclusively with the former. <br /><br />Lia's doctors ascribed her seizures to the misfiring of her cerebral neurons; her parents called her illness <i>qaug dab peg</i> - the spirit catches you and you fall down - and ascribed it to the wandering of her soul. The doctors prescribed anticonvulsants; her parents preferred animal sacrifices."

      "<b>“So long, Carrie Bradshaw—there’s a new role model for go-getting thirty-somethings. Gabrielle Bernstein is doling out inner peace and self-love for the postmodern spiritual set.”—<i>Elle</i></b><br /><br /><b>Foreword by Marianne Williamson</b><br /><br />Before she became a celebrated teacher and lecturer, Gabrielle Bernstein was going down a dangerous path. For years, Bernstein struggled with eating disorders, drug and alcohol abuse, and constant self-doubt and self-loathing. That all changed when she discovered&#xa0;<i>A Course in Miracles</i>, which taught her that much of what she feared in life was not frightening at all and, in many cases, not even real.<br /><br />Now, Bernstein lives an empowered, healthy, and joyful life. In&#xa0;<i>Spirit Junkie</i>, Bernstein guides readers through the life-changing lessons that shaped her spiritual journey: how we become accustomed to fearful ways of thinking, how to recognize and change those thought patterns to make way for bliss, and how to maintain our happiness and share it with the world. By understanding and changing our perceptions, hang-ups will melt away, resentments will release, and a childlike faith in joy will be reignited.<br />&#xa0;<br /><b>Praise for&#xa0;<i>Spirit Junkie</i><br /><br /></b>“For those ready to give up their addiction to suffering or who simply need to release the general malaise of a too-busy, too shallow way of life,&#xa0;<i>Spirit Junkie</i>&#xa0;is a soothing balm for the soul. &#xa0;Gabrielle Bernstein is a brilliant shining guide for all who seek to have more love, more light and more miracles in their life.”<b>—Arielle Ford, author of&#xa0;<i>The Soulmate Secret</i>&#xa0;</b>"

      "There's a voice in the universe calling each of us to remember our purpose, our reason for being here now, in this world of impermanence. The voice whispers, shouts, and sings to us that this experience of being in form, in space and time, knowing life and death, has meaning. The voice is that of inspiration, which is within each and every one of us.<br /> The feelings of emptiness; the idea that there must be something more; wondering \"Is this all there is?\" and trying to determine the meaning of life; this is all evidence of a yearning to reconnect with our soul space. We're aching for our calling to be felt and expressed.<br /><br /> In this groundbreaking audiobook, Dr. Wayne W. Dyer explains how we've chosen to enter this world of particles and form. From our place of origin, in ways that we don't readily comprehend now, we knew what we were coming here to accomplish, and we participated in setting this life process in motion. So why not think this same way? Why put the responsibility or blame on any one or any thing that's not a part of us? On Earth we have the capacity of volition, we can choose, so let's assume that we had the same capacity when we resided in the spiritual realm. We chose our physical body, and we chose the parents we needed for the trip. It doesn't seem too great a stretch to move into the idea that we chose this life in concert with our Source.<br /><br /> Each chapter in this audiobook is filled with specifics for living an inspired life. From a very personal viewpoint, Wayne Dyer offers a blueprint through the world of spirit to inspiration, your ultimate calling."

      "In this <i>New York Times</i> and <i>Wall Street Journal</i> bestseller, Whole Foods Market cofounder John Mackey and professor and Conscious Capitalism, Inc. cofounder Raj Sisodia argue for the inherent good of both business and capitalism. Featuring some of today’s best-known and most successful companies, they illustrate how these two forces can—and do—work most powerfully to create value for all stakeholders, including customers, employees, suppliers, investors, society, and the environment.<br /><br /><i>Conscious Capitalism</i> helps us better understand how companies such as Southwest Airlines, Costco, UPS, Panera, Patagonia, Google, The Container Store, and many others, use four specific tenets—higher purpose, stakeholder integration, conscious leadership, and conscious culture and management—to build strong businesses, advance capitalism toward its highest potential, and foster a more positive environment for all of us."
